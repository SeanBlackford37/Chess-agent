## Agent Information

Internal Agents: \
Meta agent that can plug different agents together <br />
Simple rules-based reflex agent <br />
Opening move agent <br />
Search-based by depth agent <br />

Simple AI agent code location: \
src\main\java\ithaca\teamfour\playerâ€¦

How to set up/run the unit tests of the environment: <br /> 
Unit testing (Made sure the AI is doing things correctly)

How a human can act as an agent: \
Make sure to have a human player in the main where the ChessGame line is, it should look like this, but you can replace the MetaAgent with whatever secondary agent you want to play against 
```
ChessGame game = new ChessGame(new Board(),  new HumanPlayer(), new MetaAgent(player1));
```
Then run the ChessMain and enter coordinates of a move you want to do on your turn

The sensor and actuator interfaces are located in the codebase: \
src\main\java\ithaca\teamfour\player\ChessGame.java
